# Security Policy

## Security Features

ArgosOS implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities.

### üîê API Key Security
- **Encryption**: API keys are encrypted using Fernet (AES 128) before storage
- **No Exposure**: API keys are never exposed via HTTP endpoints
- **Secure Storage**: Keys stored in encrypted files, not in environment variables
- **Validation**: API key format validation before storage

### üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation
- **File Validation**: Comprehensive file type, size, and name validation
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **MIME Type Validation**: Strict MIME type checking
- **Size Limits**: 100MB maximum file size limit
- **Filename Sanitization**: Removes dangerous characters from filenames

### üö´ SQL Injection Protection
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Raw SQL Disabled**: LLM-generated SQL queries are disabled for security
- **Input Sanitization**: Search queries are validated for SQL keywords
- **ORM Usage**: Database operations use ORM methods, not raw SQL

### üåê CORS Security
- **Restricted Origins**: Only allows specific localhost origins
- **Header Restrictions**: Limits allowed headers to essential ones
- **Credential Control**: Proper credential handling configuration

### üìÅ File Upload Security
- **Type Validation**: Only allows specific file types
- **Size Validation**: Enforces file size limits
- **Content Validation**: Validates file content before processing
- **Safe Storage**: Files processed in memory, not saved to disk
